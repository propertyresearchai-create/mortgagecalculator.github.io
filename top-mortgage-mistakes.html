                    Buying your first home is an exciting milestone, but the mortgage process can be overwhelming. Many first-time buyers make costly mistakes that could have been easily avoided with proper preparation and knowledge. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the top 10 mortgage mistakes and how you can steer clear of them.
                </p>
                
                <h2>1. Not Checking Your Credit Score Early</h2>
                <p>
                    Your credit score plays a crucial role in determining your mortgage interest rate and loan approval. Many first-time buyers wait until they're ready to apply before checking their credit, only to discover issues that could take months to resolve. Check your credit score at least 6-12 months before you plan to buy.
                </p>
                
                <h2>2. Skipping Pre-Approval</h2>
                <p>
                    Getting pre-approved for a mortgage gives you a realistic budget and shows sellers you're a serious buyer. Without pre-approval, you might waste time looking at homes you can't afford or lose out on your dream home to a pre-approved buyer.
                </p>
                
                <h2>3. Overlooking Additional Costs</h2>
                <p>
                    First-time buyers often focus solely on the down payment and monthly mortgage payment, forgetting about closing costs, property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA fees, and maintenance expenses. These can add thousands to your overall housing costs.
                </p>
                
                <h2>4. Making Major Financial Changes</h2>
                <p>
                    During the mortgage process, avoid making large purchases, opening new credit cards, or changing jobs. These actions can affect your credit score and debt-to-income ratio, potentially jeopardizing your loan approval.
                </p>
                
                <h2>5. Not Shopping Around for Rates</h2>
                <p>
                    Many buyers accept the first mortgage offer they receive without comparing rates from multiple lenders. Even a small difference in interest rates can save you tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.
                </p>
                
                <h2>6. Choosing the Wrong Loan Type</h2>
                <p>
                    There are various mortgage types available, including FHA, VA, conventional, and USDA loans. Each has different requirements and benefits. Research which loan type best suits your financial situation and long-term goals.
                </p>
                
                <h2>7. Maxing Out Your Budget</h2>
                <p>
                    Just because you're approved for a certain amount doesn't mean you should borrow the maximum. Leave room in your budget for unexpected expenses, lifestyle changes, and other financial goals.
                </p>
                
                <h2>8. Ignoring the Importance of a Home Inspection</h2>
                <p>
                    While not directly related to your mortgage, skipping a home inspection to save money can be a costly mistake. Hidden problems could leave you with expensive repairs and potentially affect your home's value.
                </p>
                
                <h2>9. Not Understanding Mortgage Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure you understand key mortgage terms like APR, points, escrow, PMI, and amortization. Don't be afraid to ask your lender to explain anything you don't understand before signing.
                </p>
                
                <h2>10. Putting Down Less Than 20%</h2>
                <p>
                    While it's possible to buy a home with as little as 3-5% down, putting down less than 20% typically requires private mortgage insurance (PMI), which increases your monthly payment. If possible, save for a larger down payment to avoid PMI and secure better loan terms.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Avoiding these common mortgage mistakes can save you thousands of dollars and significant stress during the homebuying process. Take your time, do your research, and don't hesitate to seek advice from mortgage professionals. With proper preparation, you'll be well-positioned to secure the best mortgage for your first home.
